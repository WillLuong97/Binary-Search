#Python3 implementation of leetcode 81. Search in Rotated Sorted Array I and II using Binary search

#Problem statement: 
#search in a sorted rotated array I
'''
You are given an integer array nums sorted in ascending order, and an integer target.

Suppose that nums is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand (i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

If target is found in the array return its index, otherwise, return -1.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1

#Function to find the target in a sorted rotated array: 
def search_I(self, nums, target):

#Function to find the target in a sorted array with duplicate:

#Driver code to execute the two main function: 
def main():
	print("TESTING SEARCHING IN ROTATED SORTED ARRAY I...")
	test_nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
	test_target = 0

	test_nums_01 = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
	test_target = 3

	print()
